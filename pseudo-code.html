<!-- pseudo code
    WHEN user clicks on Generate PW button, 
    PROMPT user to input how many characters they want their pw to be.
 
    IF userLength is <8 || >128
    ALERT user to enter a password length of 8 to 128 characters

    IF userLength is >=8 || <=128
    ALERTS will pop up to confirm the following:

    CONFIRM: Do you want your pw to include special chars?
    IF user clicks "ok", include special chars in pw
    ELSE do not include special chars in pw
    
    CONFIRM: Do you want your pw to include lowercase chars?
    IF user clicks "ok", include lowercase chars in pw
    ELSE do not include lowercase chars in pw

    CONFIRM: Do you want your pw to include uppercase chars?
    IF user clicks "ok", include uppercase chars in pw
    ELSE do not include uppercase chars in pw

    CONFIRM: Do you want your pw to include numeric chars?
    IF user clicks "ok", include numeric chars in pw
    ELSE do not include numeric chars in pw

    IF at least one criteria has been met:
    IF useSPecial OR (||) useNums OR useLower OR or useUpper 

    THEN generate random pw, and
    ALERT user to click the generate pw button to display their pw in the text box

    *Note: arrays will be helpful here.-->
